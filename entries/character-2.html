    <p class="description-text">Naganohara Yoimiya, the cheerful and energetic owner of Naganohara Fireworks in Inazuma, is a character full of passion and warmth. Known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival," she spreads joy and excitement with her fireworks, which she crafts with meticulous care and creativity. Yoimiya's love for fireworks goes beyond mere aesthetics—they represent her desire to bring happiness to others, and each display is infused with her optimism and sense of wonder. Her personality is vibrant and friendly, making her beloved by the people in her community. She has an infectious enthusiasm and a childlike curiosity, always eager to learn and experience new things. Despite her carefree nature, Yoimiya is deeply loyal and protective of her friends. She has a strong sense of justice, standing up for those in need, and isn't afraid to take risks when helping others. In battle, Yoimiya's pyrotechnic skills shine as brightly as her fireworks. Wielding a bow infused with the Pyro element, she combines agility and precision to unleash explosive attacks, lighting up the battlefield. Her passion for fireworks mirrors her spirit—bright, bold, and impossible to ignore—making Yoimiya a radiant and uplifting presence in any team.</p>
