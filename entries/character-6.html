    <p class="description-text">Mika Schmidt is a character in Genshin Impact introduced as a young cartographer and surveyor from Mondstadt. Though shy and soft-spoken, Mika is incredibly dedicated to his work within the Knights of Favonius, specifically under the Reconnaissance Company led by Eula. His diligent nature, keen attention to detail, and deep love for cartography make him an essential part of the team. Mika often prefers the quiet solitude of the field, where he can focus on his mapping duties, but he is also eager to support his fellow knights in any way he can. Mika is characterized by his humility and modesty. Despite his talents, he tends to shy away from the spotlight, feeling more comfortable working behind the scenes. His meek and gentle demeanor is often contrasted by his strong sense of loyalty to his comrades. He admires and respects his superiors, especially Eula, and is always looking to improve himself to be of greater service to the team. Though not particularly confident in combat, Mika is resourceful and clever, often finding practical solutions in challenging situations. His reserved nature hides a heart full of determination, and through quiet perseverance, Mika proves to be an invaluable asset to the Knights of Favonius.</p>
