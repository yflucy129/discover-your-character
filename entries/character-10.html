    <p class="description-text">Sangonomiya Kokomi is the leader of the Sangonomiya Resistance and the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island in Genshin Impact. Known for her calm, strategic mind and gentle disposition, Kokomi is a natural leader despite her dislike for direct confrontation. She holds immense responsibility, managing not only the resistance’s military efforts but also the well-being of the island’s people, acting as both a spiritual and practical guide. Kokomi's personality is defined by her intellect, compassion, and sense of duty. She is a master strategist, relying on careful planning and diplomacy rather than brute force in battle. Her leadership style is thoughtful and empathetic, ensuring that every decision benefits the greater good. Despite her tactical brilliance, Kokomi has a humble nature and doesn’t seek the spotlight. She prefers to work behind the scenes, quietly supporting her people. Beneath her composed exterior, Kokomi struggles with the heavy burden of leadership. Her responsibilities often leave her feeling drained, and she longs for moments of solitude to recharge her energy, where she can indulge in her personal interests, like reading or studying military strategy. In combat, Kokomi’s Hydro abilities emphasize healing and support, reflecting her nurturing and protective nature, as she always prioritizes the safety and well-being of her allies.</p>
