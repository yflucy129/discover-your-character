    <p class="description-text">Freminet Snezhevich is a reserved and introverted character in Genshin Impact, hailing from the icy region of Snezhnaya. A skilled diver and mechanic, Freminet prefers the solitude of the ocean depths, where he can focus on his love for underwater exploration and engineering. His expertise lies in operating complex machinery and salvaging valuable resources from beneath the sea, making him a resourceful and practical individual. Freminetâ€™s personality is marked by his quiet, thoughtful nature. He is not one for words, often keeping to himself and finding comfort in solitude. While he may come across as distant or aloof, his introspective demeanor reflects a deeper sensitivity and intelligence. Freminet feels more at home beneath the water, where he can escape the noise of the world above and immerse himself in the tranquility of the ocean. His passion for diving and machinery speaks to his meticulous attention to detail and patience. Though Freminet tends to avoid social interactions, he is deeply loyal to those he cares about, particularly his siblings, Lyney and Lynette. He may struggle with expressing his emotions, but his actions show his commitment and affection. In combat, Freminet utilizes his skills in engineering and Hydro-based abilities, often relying on mechanical precision and tactical approaches to outsmart opponents.</p>
